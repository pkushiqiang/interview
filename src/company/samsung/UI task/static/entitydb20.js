The Nine Network is one of five main free-to-air commercial networks in Australia. The Nine Network has been the second highest rating television network in Australia since 2007, behind the Seven Network and ahead of Network Ten, ABC and SBS. Nine had historically been the highest rating television network since television\u0027s inception in Australia in 1956 for most years up to 2006, although Network Ten had dominated in 1985 and for a number of years in the 1970s. The Nine Network\u0027s was overtaken in the ratings in 2007 by its rival, the Seven Network, which has dominated ever since. As a result, Nine\u0027s slogan \"Still the One\" was discontinued. Since 2009, the network\u0027s slogan has been \"Welcome Home\". After a few years in slight decline, with a period plagued by mass-sackings, programme cancellations and budget cuts, the Nine Network has enjoyed a period of stability.","image":"http://wikiname2image.herokuapp.com/Nine_Network"},
